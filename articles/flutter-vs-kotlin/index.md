Mobile application development has become an essential part of the software business in recent years. Developers used to prefer ReactNative (or Flutter to a lesser extent) to develop cross-platform applications due to their low-cost features. Today, another cross-platform language named Kotlin has also managed to enter into the world of cross-platform development. Since then Flutter has also managed to improve a lot in the past years, and it now provides better features than ReactNative.  

In this article, we will be comparing Flutter & Kotlin as cross-platform development languages. The primary goal of this article is to help developers distinguish the best cross-development platform for them, depending on their needs, and skills.

### Performance
Kotlin and Flutter, are superb choices when it comes to mobile app development, both with their own distinctions. Kotlin can compile the code and customize it to the best needs of its user as well as the native apps.

Flutter has a reloading functionality, that gives the developer a choice of selection if all the different elements are performing well.

Developers describe Flutter as one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Kotlin, however, is described more as a statistical-type programming language.

### Language
One of the main advantages of Kotlin is that its programming language is quite similar to Java. Therefore developers who have worked with Java in the past will find it much easier to work with Kotlin. 
On the other hand, Flutter uses Dart from Google. Due to the fact that Dart is widely used, it may offer an easier option for developers to understand and operate Flutter.

### Price and Testing
Kotlin and Flutter are both free, but the real difference occurs in testing support. While Kotlin tends to support backend development, Flutter works on extensive testing of features.

### UI Support
Kotlin as a multi-platform development tool has a unique distinction of lending a helping hand to UI developers and allows them to make a truly customizable app without restrictions. On the other hand, developers working with Flutter can take full advantage of widgets, which also helps in crafting customized solutions.

### Pros of Kotlin
Kotlin is an SDK, so it is not necessary to shift the complete app to the platform. Due to its similarities with Java, developers find it easier to get a handle on it and use a multi-frame to design a cross-platform app. Since the UI creation is not restricted, developers have the freedom to work on any aspect of the app.

### Cons of Kotlin
There are very few built-in widgets and libraries available for developers, as Kotlin is still new in the market and still growing. Once the date-time library arrives, the situation will improve. The development cost for Kotlin is quite high as well, and it will eventually be the desired option for the developers in the long run.
According to [HiddenBrains](https://www.hiddenbrains.com/blog/kotlin-vs-flutter-rule-android.html), an app developer must have highly developed skills to understand each platform and use APIs to handle Kotlin well.

### Companies using Kotlin
Below is a list of a few of the major companies that are using Kotlin.
- Chalk

- AutoDesk

- Careem

- Yandex

- Quizlet

- TouchLab

### Pros of Flutter
The operating and development costs of Flutter are significantly lower than Kotlin. The hot reload functionality of Flutter mobile app development is also an important feature to highlight. 
Customized facilities can be easily developed due to a large number of built-in widgets.

### Cons of Flutter
The language Dart used in Flutter is still not common in the industry, which becomes an obstacle for Developers as one needs to learn a new language to develop apps in Flutter. The framework size of Dart is quite large. Thus, the apps are much bigger, which is detrimental to app development in Flutter today.

### Companies using Flutter
According to the [Flutter's Website](https://flutter.dev/showcase) some of the most prominent companies using Flutter are:

- GoogleAds - The Google Ads app helps users manage, optimize, and track ad campaigns all from the convenience of an android device.

- Groupon - Groupon uses Flutter to help hundreds of thousands of merchants track campaign performance, manage customer satisfaction, and get efficient support.

- Square - The Flutter plugin for our Square Reader SDK enables developers to build apps for merchants that take in-person payments.

- eBay - The eBay Motors app is a powerful tool for browsing, buying, and selling vehicles directly from consumer's phones.

- Alibaba - Alibaba, the world's biggest online commerce company, used Flutter to create a beautiful app experience for iOS and Android on their Xianyu app.

- Phillips - Flutter brought intuitive controls to Philips Hue apps, allowing users to set the mood and sync their smart lights to their media quickly and easily.

### Summary
Both languages are designed to suit the developer's needs and are the most used languages for cross-platform development. Both these platforms are known to be reliable. They aim at decreasing the time and expense of the app development and offer improved app performance.

Both languages are said to be the hottest up-and-coming developments of the mobile application industry.

There is no ultimate or clear winner between both these languages we discussed. It ultimately depends on the needs (of the application youâ€™re developing) and the skills of the developer. Sometimes the advantages of any framework best suit developers' needs. But, those advantages can be useless for other developers if they lack those same skills.
