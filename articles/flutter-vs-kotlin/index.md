Mobile application development has become an essential part of the software business in recent years. Previously, people preferred ReactNative or Flutter to develop cross-platform applications due to their low-cost features. But today, Kotlin has also managed to enter into the world of cross-platform development.

Since Flutter has been improved a lot in the past years, it now provides better features than ReactNative.  Kotlin has also entered the space of cross-platform development as well.

In this article, we will be comparing the new languages for cross-platform development. The primary goal of this article is to help developers distinguish the best cross-development platform for them, depending on their needs and skills.

### PERFORMANCE
When it come to mobile app development, both Kotlin and Flutter are each superb with some distinctions. Kotlin can compile the code and customize it to the best needs of its user as well as the native apps.

Flutter allows reloading functionality, giving the developer a choice of selection if all the different elements are performing well.

Developers describe Flutter as one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Kotlin, however, is described as a statistical-type programming language.

### LANGUAGE
The main advantage of Kotlin is that its programming language is quite similar to Java. Developers who have worked with Java will find it much easier to work with Kotlin. On the other hand, Flutter uses Dart from Google. Due to the fact that Dart is remarkably used, it is easier to understand and operate, which makes Flutter a good option for the developers.

### PRICE AND TESTING
Both Kotlin and Flutter are free, but the real difference occurs in testing support. While Kotlin tends to support backend development, Flutter works on extensive testing features.

### UI SUPPORT
Kotlin as a multi-platform development tool has a unique distinction of lending a freehand to the UI developer to make an app without restrictions and make a truly customized app. On the other hand, developers can take the help of widgets if they are working with Flutter, which also helps in customized solutions.

### PROS OF KOTLIN
Kotlin is an SDK, so it is not necessary to shift the complete app to the platform. Due to its similarities with Java, developers find it easier to get a hand on it and use a multi-frame to design a cross-platform app. Since UI creation is not restricted, Developers have the freedom to work on any aspect of the app.

### CONS OF KOTLIN
Very few built-in widgets and libraries are available for developers as Kotlin is still new on the market and is still growing. Once the date-time library arrives, the situation will improve. The development cost is quite high as well, and it will eventually be desired option for the developers in the long run. According to [HiddenBrains](https://www.hiddenbrains.com/blog/kotlin-vs-flutter-rule-android.html), the app developer must have highly developed skills to understand each platform and use APIs to handle Kotlin well.

### COMPANIES USING KOTLIN

- Chalk

- AutoDesk

- Careem

- Yandex

- Quizlet

- TouchLab

### PROS OF FLUTTER
The operating cost and development charges of Flutter are significantly lower than Kotlin. Hot reload functionality of Flutter mobile app development is an important feature. Customized facilities can be easily developed due to a large number of inbuilt widgets.

### CONS OF FLUTTER
The language Dart used in Flutter is still not common in the industry, which becomes an obstacle for Developers as one needs to learn a new language to develop apps in Flutter. The framework size of Dart is quite large. Thus, the apps are much bigger, which is detrimental to app development in Flutter today.

### COMPANIES USING FLUTTER
According to the [Flutter's Website](https://flutter.dev/showcase) some of the most prominent companies using Flutter are:

- GoogleAds - The Google Ads app helps users manage, optimize, and track ad campaigns all from the convenience of an android device.

- Groupon - Groupon uses Flutter to help hundreds of thousands of merchants track campaign performance, manage customer satisfaction, and get efficient support.

- Square - The Flutter plugin for our Square Reader SDK enables developers to build apps for merchants that take in-person payments.

- eBay - The eBay Motors app is a powerful tool for browsing, buying, and selling vehicles directly from consumer's phones.

- Alibaba - Alibaba, the world's biggest online commerce company, used Flutter to create a beautiful app experience for iOS and Android on their Xianyu app.

- Phillips - Flutter brought intuitive controls to Philips Hue apps, allowing users to set the mood and sync their smart lights to their media quickly and easily.

### SUMMARY
Both languages are designed to suit the developer's needs and are the most used languages for cross-platform development. Both these platforms are known to be reliable. They aim at decreasing the time and expense of the app development and offer improved app performance.

Both languages are said to be the hottest up-and-coming developments of the mobile application industry.

There is no ultimate winner between both languages. But, it depends on the needs and skills of the programmer. Sometimes the advantages of any framework best suit developers' needs. But, those advantages can be useless for other developers if they lack the skills.
